All plans, even free plans, have access to APIs (Application Programming Interfaces), allowing you to use our technology and all its functions programmatically through code. APIs are the basic components that applications that use DUIX or any other service rely on. In this section, we'll provide a fairly concise overview of how to create our first DUIX session using the API to make a request to the endpoint. It is worth noting that the website is only the front end of the API. Therefore, if you experience a session demo or call the API directly with code, there should be no difference in quality or output under the same settings. However, it is still non-deterministic, so the delivery of the generated output may vary. The API call to connect to the session requires consuming credits. Therefore, if you have 10,000 credits in your account, and you create a session, you need to consume the corresponding credits when using the API to call the session. For your convenience, you can first go to [Purchase a plan](https://duix.com/pricing), or you can use the free quota to verify the process first. Given the breadth of APIs and the almost limitless possibilities, we'll do a very quick overview and show some examples so you can get up and running quickly.
