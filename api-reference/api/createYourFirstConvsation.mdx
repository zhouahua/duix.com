### Create a Session
Then create your first session on the ```Create Session``` page. You can choose your preferred ```Avatar```, ```Background```, and ```Voice```. You can select which ```Models``` to use and the ```Language``` for the conversation. If you choose a model other than GPT4O, you can also set up ```Opening remarks``` so that the digital human will speak first when the conversation begins.

### Get appid/key and Session id
Click ```Next``` to obtain your ```app id```, ```app key```, and ```Session id```. Click the "copy" icon to copy them for use. Do not show your app key to others. If someone gets access to your app key, they can use your account just like they have your password.
