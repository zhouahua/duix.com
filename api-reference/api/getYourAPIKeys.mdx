### Create Application
If you are not using the DUIX API for the first time or want to create more applications, click on the "Profile" icon in the upper right corner of the website, then click ```Platform``` to access your workspace.

Once in the workspace, click on the "Gear" icon in the upper left corner of the page. Next, click ```API Keys``` to find the ```app id``` and ```app key``` you have already created.![my.png](https://github.com/zhouahua/duix.com/blob/main/images/my.png?raw=true)
Click ```Create APPKey```, set the ```appkey name```, and you can create a new application. When you click to copy, you can paste it into a document to view your ```app id``` and ```app key```.![apikeys.png](https://github.com/zhouahua/duix.com/blob/main/images/apikeys.png?raw=true)
Note: Do not show your app-key to others. If someone gets access to your app-key, they can use your account just like they have your password.
