The Conversational Video Interface (CVI) is an end-to-end pipeline for creating real-time multimodal video conversations with a replica that can see, hear, and respond similarly to how a human would. Developers can deploy video AI agents in minutes using CVI.

CVI is the world's fastest interface of its kind, allowing you to put a human face and conversational ability to your AI agent or personality. With CVI, you can achieve utterance-to-utterance latency with SLAs as fast as under 1 second, which is the full roundtrip time for a participant to say something and for the replica to speak back.

CVI provides a complete pipeline to have a conversation while also allowing you to customize and plug in your existing components where necessary.

## Key Features

## Face-to-face interactions

The first interface that speaks our language. CVI is multimodal and understands and uses facial expressions, body language, and has natural conversational awareness including interrupts and turn-taking.

## World's lowest latency

The world's fastest interface of its kind, with SLAs as fast as under 1s latency utterance-to-utterance.

## End-to-end solution

CVI provides a turn-key solution, delivering all the components to easily deploy AI video agents without having to worry about WebRTC, ASR, or anything else.

## Focused on naturalness

Easily create high-quality AI replicas of you or your customers, powered by our state-of-the-art replica models.

## What components does CVI provide, and what can I customize?

CVI provides a full pipeline allowing you to easily create video conversations. You can immediately jump into a real-time conversation with the generated Session link URL. CVI provides the following layers:

*   WebRTC/Session link (using Daily)
    
*   Speech recognition (ASR), with interrupts, and Semantic/Lexical turn taking, using our model.
    
*   Optimized, conversational LLM
    
*   Text-to-speech (TTS)
    

You can choose to customize or bring your own layers as well. For example, you can:

*   Use OpenAI real-time API or other voice-to-voice models
    
*   Bring your own LLM/conversation logic or enable function calling for DUIX-optimized LLMs.
    
*   Customize the TTS or ASR engine, and turn taking settings
    
*   Use text parrot mode to directly drive a replica video.
    
*   Directly access the video streams and create a custom UI.
    

## Key Concepts

### What is a conversation?

A conversation is a single 'session' or 'call' with a replica using CVI. When you create a conversation, you receive a Session link URL. This URL provides a full Real-time conversations solution, allowing you to avoid managing WebRTC or websockets. Navigating to this URL lets you chat with your replica.

### What are personas?

Personas are the 'character' or 'AI agent personality' and contain all the settings and configuration for that character or agent. For example, you can create a persona for 'Tim the Sales Agent' or 'Rob the Interviewer'. Personas let you customize CVI's layers and prompt the LLM with personality and context.

### What are replicas?

A replica is a talking-head/avatar of a human containing a voice and face clone, used as the video output layer for CVI. You can use stock replicas from DUIX or create your own with a few minutes of training data. A replica is key for video generation and CVI.
