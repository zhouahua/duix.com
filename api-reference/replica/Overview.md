# Overview

Overview of Duix's Replica offerings- Stock Replicas and Personal Replicas, all powered by the AI model. Get tips on how to create the perfect replica, and how to get a high quality output.

A Replica is a realistic video model of a human created using the AI Model. The AI model is a fully-synthetic 2D based model that generates realistic replica videos from just a script, complete with natural face (lip, cheek, nose, chin) movements and expressions synchronized with your script and generated voice. Developed by our team

Replicas are created using just 2 minutes of training data, and are designed to learn how someone speaks and sounds, how they look, and how they move their face while speaking. Using a Replica you can generate hyper-realistic videos that look and sound just like you

It's important to provide a high-quality input video in order to get great outputs from a Replica. Your Replica will attempt to mimic your gestures and movements, as well as your accent, even if you generate a video in a different language.

Here's an example of an output from one of our Stock Replicas:

Personal Replicas

Train once, and re-use endlessly without having to record again

Personal Replicas allow you to train a new Replica of a human using the AI model, from just 2 minutes of training data. Personal Replicas take between 4-6 hours to train. You can only train Replicas using training data that has a verbal consent statement. Personal Replicas go through Voice and Face ID checks to ensure consent is present.
